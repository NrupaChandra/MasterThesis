about this version :

version 5 is about optimizing the hyperparameters for the studay for this version the following parameters are optimized : 

    # Sample hyperparameters for model architecture and training.
    num_shared_layers = trial.suggest_int("num_shared_layers", 1, 8) #  tells Optuna to sample an integer hyperparameter named "num_shared_layers" from the range 1 to 3 (inclusive).
    hidden_dim = trial.suggest_categorical("hidden_dim", [128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048]) # tells Optuna to choose one value from the given list 
    output_dim = trial.suggest_categorical("output_dim", [256, 512, 1024])
    dropout_rate = trial.suggest_uniform("dropout_rate", 0.0, 0.5) # instructs Optuna to sample a floating-point value for "dropout_rate" uniformly from 0.0 to 0.5.
    learning_rate = trial.suggest_loguniform("lr", 1e-5, 1e-2) # samples a learning rate from a log-uniform distribution
    weight_decay = trial.suggest_loguniform("weight_decay", 1e-6, 1e-2)
    batch_size = trial.suggest_categorical("batch_size", [256, 512, 1024])
    max_output_len = trial.suggest_categorical("max_output_len", [16, 32, 64])
