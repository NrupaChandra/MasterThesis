about this version : 

- Has a FNN arcticture (with Residual block)
- NO nodal representation
-The 12 input values (4 coeff, 4 exp x, 4 exp y) values are passed through a feedforward network that consists of:

Input Layer: A fully connected layer mapping from num_nodes to hidden_dim, followed by ReLU activation.
Residual Blocks (PreActResidualBlock): A stack of 6 residual blocks that enhance feature extraction and stability. Each block contains:
ReLU activation
Linear transformation
Dropout (0.1 probability)
Batch normalization
Second linear transformation
Skip connection (residual connection) for stable gradient propagation.
Shared Hidden Layer: A dense layer after residual blocks to refine features.

-Prediction Heads
The model has two separate branches:

Nodes Prediction Branch
Predicts x and y coordinates for a set of points.
Uses tanh activation to ensure values remain within a reasonable range.
Weights Prediction Branch
Predicts associated weights.
Uses softplus activation to ensure weights remain non-negative.

-It uses single precission (float 32)

-The test function while training are 9 legendre polynomials.
