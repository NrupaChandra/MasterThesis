about this version : AFFECT OF PENALTY LOSS ON THE MODEL 

- Has a FNN arcticture 
- It implements nodal representation with normailzation 
-The nodal values are passed through a feedforward network that consists of:

-very shallow network , after noramilzation the network, splits into 3 branches , 1 for node x position, 1 for node y position, and 1 for weight position.
-uses softplus activation for weights to remain positive, uses tanh for nodes to be in the range of (-1, 1)


-It uses single precission (float 32)

-The test function while training are 9 legendre polynomials.

Training : 

- During trainin only integration loss and level set penalty is present
